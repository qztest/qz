But one of its most recent accomplishments is in an area that&#8217;s considerably more basic: ballpoint pens.<\/p>\n<p>Today Chinese steelmaker Taiyuan Iron and Steel Co., also known as Taigang, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tisco.com.cn\/gongsixinwen\/2017011109043018776.html\">formally announced<\/a> (link in Chinese) that it had developed technology to manufacture the stainless steel tip cases found at the end of high-quality ballpoint pens. The feat shows how the Chinese government remains insecure about the country&#8217;s continued reliance on foreign technology, and the lengths it&#8217;s willing to go to overcome it.<\/p>\n<p>China produces an estimated 40 billion ballpoint pens annually, but many of them work poorly. Domestic manufacturers wanting to make higher-quality pens must import tip cases from Japan and Germany made of a specialized stainless steel. According to Taigang, an 83-year-old state-owned enterprise based in the Shanxi province, that&#8217;s because in better pens the cone-shaped case that holds the ball requires both <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tisco.com.cn\/gongsixinwen\/2017011109043018776.html\">special raw material and special machinery<\/a> (link in Chinese). To fulfill demand, Chinese pen makers have been <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bjnews.com.cn\/finance\/2017\/01\/11\/430190.html\">importing more than 1,000 tons<\/a> (link in Chinese) of the needed steel annually.<\/p>\n<p>In 2011 Taigang and government bureaus allocated 60 million yuan ($8.6 million) toward researching the technology needed to develop the part independently. The company says trials <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bjnews.com.cn\/finance\/2017\/01\/11\/430190.html\">began in earnest in 2014<\/a> (link in Chinese) and finally finished last year, when a set of 2.3-mm-tipped pens with the superior tip cases passed the ultimate test&mdash;the ability to write for 800 meters (875 yards) without interruption. The company will supply the tip cases to Beifa, a pen maker based in the city of Ningbo in the Zhejiang province. It&#8217;s unclear when the resulting pens will officially hit the market, or why Taigang is announcing the news now.<\/p>\n<p>Taigang&#8217;s efforts didn&#8217;t come out of nowhere. A year ago in China a <a href=\"http:\/\/news.ifeng.com\/a\/20160111\/47015988_0.shtml\">minor media frenzy erupted<\/a> (link in Chinese) when premier Li Keqiang, a vocal proponent of bolstering technological innovation, lamented how China was producing 800 million tons of steel annually but still importing the specialized type of stainless steel needed to make the better tip cases.<\/p>\n<p>He reiterated this point frequently during public appearances, adding that pens using domestically produced parts felt inferior to foreign ones. The ballpoint pen became a potent symbol for perceived flaws in China&#8217;s economy and technological capabilities. &#8220;That&#8217;s the real situation facing us,&#8221; Li said at a meeting with economists <a href=\"http:\/\/www.china.org.cn\/business\/2015-12\/04\/content_37231190.htm\">in December 2015<\/a>. &#8220;We cannot make ballpoint pens with a smooth writing function.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>At one point last year, state-media outlet CCTV broadcast an hour-long program examining why China couldn&#8217;t make quality tip casings for ballpoint pens on its own.<\/p>\n<p>News of Taigang&#8217;s pen-tip &#8220;innovation&#8221; has made waves on China&#8217;s internet in the past few days. An article about the company from state media outlet People&#8217;s Daily has so far attracted over 10,000 comments and 20,000 shares on Weibo, China&#8217;s Twitter-esque social media platform. &#8220;Wow<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">, it had never occurred to me that I had been using ballpoint pens relying on foreign technology!&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/WOW, it had never occured to me that I had been using ballpoint pens relying on foreign technology! But China can finally make their own ballpoint pens now! It&rsquo;s not easy\">wrote one user<\/a> (link in Chinese). <\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Chinese government has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2014-12-17\/china-said-to-plan-sweeping-shift-from-foreign-technology-to-own\">repeatedly stressed the importance<\/a> of keeping its domestic technology competitive with foreign alternatives. While that has typically manifested itself in R&amp;D funding for the internet and semiconductor industries, the ballpoint pen has proven to be a more useful symbol for capturing the imaginations of ordinary Chinese.<\/p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not the only pedestrian product public figures have held up in the name of bolstering innovation. Last March Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun appeared at China&#8217;s annual &#8220;Two Meetings&#8221; political gathering to lament how Japan&#8217;s rice cookers were superior to those made domestically. Weeks later, his company announced a <a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/650522\/chinas-150-rice-cooker-is-not-about-making-rice-its-about-beating-japan\/\">wifi-enabled rice cooker<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Beifa and Taigang say that making the quality tip casings in China will save about $15 million annually. But even comments from Beifa suggest that the decision was more political than financial.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Frankly speaking, it&#8217;s not that China was incapable of developing the technology,&#8221; Beifa CEO Zhang Xuelian <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bjnews.com.cn\/finance\/2017\/01\/11\/430190.html\">told Beijing News<\/a> (link in Chinese). &#8220;This type of steel part requires a special type of steel [to make]. The market for it is not big. Only companies that make pen tips will need it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Additional reporting by Echo Huang. <\/i><\/span><\/p>\n","hero":{"id":882798,"alt":"A teacher (C) speaks to students inside a classroom of Dalu primary school in Gucheng township of Hefei, Anhui province, China, September 8, 2015.

Online publishers use anti-ad-blocking software to track whether visitors are blocking digital ads and thwart them from doing so. Privacy activists <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/e869fe78-770f-3007-b4ac-ca40ab6c7020\">reportedly argued<\/a> (paywall) that this constitutes &ldquo;access&rdquo; and therefore violated the EU&rsquo;s digital policy.<\/p>\n<p>The European Union&rsquo;s governing body is now saying that&rsquo;s not the case. To clear up any confusion, it announced a <a href=\"http:\/\/europa.eu\/rapid\/press-release_MEMO-17-17_en.htm\">proposed reform of the law<\/a> on Jan. 10 that would make it clear websites don&rsquo;t need consent to detect ad blockers on users&rsquo; devices. As the Commission wrote in a press release&rdquo;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Users have the freedom to install software on their devices that disables the display of advertisement. At the same time, the Commission is aware that &ldquo;free&rdquo; content on the internet is often funded by advertising revenue. Therefore, the proposal allows website providers to check if the end-user&rsquo;s device is able to receive their content, including advertising, without obtaining the end-user&rsquo;s consent. If a website provider notes that not all content can be received by the end-user, it is up to the website provider to respond appropriately, for example by asking end-users if they use an ad-blocker and would be willing to switch it off for the respective website.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In other words, if users have the right to block ads&mdash;a major revenue stream for many websites&mdash;publishers should, in turn, be allowed to ban users from blocking ads. Some sites, including Wired, Business Insider, and the German tabloid Bild, already do this, and there are companies, like Sourcepoint and PageFair that help digital publishers implement these anti-ad-blocking measures.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-882462-1\"><\/div><p>If a user visits these sites while using an ad blocker, they&rsquo;re normally confronted with a message overlay that says something like, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve noticed you&rsquo;re using an ad blocker.

In his view, border security must also include close cooperation with countries as far south as Peru and curbing US demand for illegal drugs.<\/p>\n<p>These nuanced positions, offered during several hours of testimony before the homeland security and governmental affairs senate committee, contrast with Trump&rsquo;s fiery campaign rhetoric. If confirmed, expect the retired general to continue speaking his mind: &ldquo;Truth to power is the way to go,&rdquo; he said during the hearing.<\/p>\n<h2>No bad <em>hombres<\/em><\/h2>\n<p>Donald Trump has repeatedly hammered on the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; of illegal immigration from Mexico, despite the fact that it has been dropping significantly in past years. During the hearing, Kelly focused on Central American immigrants, whose numbers have been swelling.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-882473-1\"><\/div><p>The way he spoke about people trying to enter the US illegally was also notably different from Trump, who referred to undocumented immigrants as &ldquo;criminals,&rdquo; &ldquo;rapists&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad <em>hombres<\/em>.&rdquo; &ldquo;They, for the most part, don&rsquo;t want to come up,&rdquo; said Kelly, who spent time in Central America as head of the US military&rsquo;s Southern Command. But they come anyway, because of the horrific level of violence in some of the region&rsquo;s countries, the lack of economic opportunity, and the belief that if they reach US soil safely, they will be allowed to stay.<\/p>\n<p>The job of Homeland Security chief is to follow the law, Kelly said&mdash;but he also promised senators he will &ldquo;keep a very open mind&rdquo; when it comes to the fate of beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The Obama administration program has allowed thousands of immigrants brought into the country illegally as children to live and, when reaching legal age of employment, work in the US.<\/p>\n<p>Kelly also said that law-abiding individuals would not be at the top of the list of people to deport&mdash;a policy in place during president Obama&rsquo;s time in office as well.<\/p>\n<h2>Southern partners<\/h2>\n<p>Kelly&rsquo;s attitude towards Latin American countries was also more generous than Trump&rsquo;s seems to be. Kelly talked about them in terms of partners and allies, instead of accusing them of shipping immigrants and drugs to the US, as Trump has repeatedly done. In fact, Kelly laid a large part of the blame of the international drug business, and the violence and public health problems it generates along trafficking routes, on the drug habit of US citizens. Even if the US blocks the entire southern border, he said, cartels would find a way to bring drugs in if people keep buying them.<\/p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" id=\"inline-882473-2\"><\/div><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tough, tough problem and it comes back to the incredible profits that flow out of our country because of the use of drugs,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\n<p>He argued that the US needs a comprehensive campaign to reduce drug demand at home, and to help countries south of the border to improve the lot of their citizens. &ldquo;At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s really improving the security on the ground and investment,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\n<h2>The Muslim community<\/h2>\n<p>Kelly also said he was against any terrorism-fighting efforts that target people on the sole basis of religion, including creating a Muslim registry. Instead, he said, his approach would be to develop ties with the communities, a strategy he credited leading to his success as a US military leader during the war in Iraq.<\/p>\n","hero":{"id":882478,"alt":"Homeland Security Secretary-designate John Kelly testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017,","caption":"The nominee.","credit":"AP Photo\/J.
